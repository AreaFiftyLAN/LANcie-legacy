      <h2>We want to come with a team, how do we make sure we sit together?</h2>
      <p>Soon, you will be able to select your seats, we’ll have parts reserved for complete teams. If you’d like to reserve a block for your team, please make sure your full team has paid tickets and then contact us to ask for reservation!</p>
      
      <h2>Do I need a team to participate in the tournaments?</h2>
      <p>All tournaments that aren't 1v1 or FFA require a team. If you don't have a team yet, don't worry! You will get the chance to form a team with other people who are also looking for a team at the start of the event.</p>

      <h2>Can I participate in multiple tournaments?</h2>
      <p>Yes! You can participate in multiple tournaments. However, keep in mind that at the end we need to be finished. Thus, if you are participating in multiple tournaments and there is a time conflict that can not be resolved, we may ask you to drop one of them.</p>
